    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Steak sauteed in a pan is maybe the simplest way of preparing a steak. To bring this method to the next level, butter basting can be used to infuse the meat with rich, garlic butter flavor in every bite</p> 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thick-cut rib-eye steak</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>   

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt steak generously 4-24 hours before cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat pan to medium high heat. Cast iron is best.</li>
        <li>Pat steak dry to remove moisture. Place steak on pan and brown one side well</li>
        <li>Flip steak and brown the other side maybe 5 more minutes</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, add unsalted butter and garlic cloves to pan to lower the temperature slightly</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, coat the steak continuously with the melted butter, angling pan to one side to ladle it over the steak</li>
        <li>Remove steak and let sit for 5 minutes before cutting</li>
    </ol>
